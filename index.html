                            <h5 class="light grey-text text-lighten-3">No off-the-shelf 3D engine was used except OpenGL. Years were devoted to developing entirely new methods and techniques. No cut scenes are ever used to make the transition from one place to another. Walk from terrain onto a spacecraft. Fly that spacecraft into space; travel to another world; choose where to enter its atmosphere and land there; step out of the spacecraft onto the terrain. The only semblance of a cut scene is a shooting-stars effect that appears as you transition from one solar system to another. The result is the biggest most realistic and usable science fiction universe that has ever been attempted.</h5>

                            <h5 class="light grey-text text-lighten-3">No places are off-limits in Shores of Hazeron. Face any direction and start to walk or swim or fly a riding beast or ride a dirt bike or sailboat. At best you'll circle the globe and return to your starting point; more likely something will kill you and eat you along the way. Build a city to manufacture spacecraft; pick a star in the sky and go there. Explore its planets and moons. Build cities and defenses. Expand your empire and prepare to meet the unknown.</h5>

                            <h5 class="light grey-text text-lighten-3">Shores of Hazeron contains millions of worlds and trillions of plants and quadrillions of creatures that no person has ever seen, not even us. Procedural generation of worlds, including the DNA of its plants and animals, results in nearly limitless variations. Fly to any planet you see; no planet is just a picture in the sky. That's not a worn out movie set down below; it's a dense jungle on the coast of a continent; something lives there. Where to land? Which troops to take on the away team?</h5>

Would your race be a typical bipedal human form, or something completely different, like a speckled two-headed bug, or a gilled fish dude with wings that flies, or even a glowing pink warty thing with a long trunk that leaps like a frog? In Shores of Hazeron you design your own race then spread your race throughout the galaxy.</h5>

Maybe a Borg cube is more your style? In Shores of Hazeron you design your own deck plans and lay out the systems of your spacecraft, balancing performance against capability, mass against force. Then you manufacture your ship and climb aboard. Simply walk|slither|hunker|crawl|fly|ride|drive through an operable door that opens and closes at your command. Turn the lights on. Walk through its halls. Use control stations to operate the systems of your spacecraft, including transporters to beam to|from planets or other spacecraft.</h5>

No matter where you find yourself, even if reduced to an empty world in some unexplored region of space, you have all that you need to reach for the stars.</h5>
