        <h1>Building Your First City</h1>
        <hr />
        <h4>The Town Square</h4>
        <img src="images/icons/Flag.png" align="left" height="32" style="margin-top: 0.8em;">
        <img src="images/FirstCityConstruction1.png" align="right" style="margin-top: 0.8em">
        <p>Every city is started by building a town square. A flag is needed to build a town square. If you do not have a flag, the materials may be present to hand craft one. On a new emperor's homeworld, the materials needed are certainly present. Read <a href="flagcraft.html">How To Hand Craft a Flag</a> for more information.</p>
        <p>Planning a town is often easier in top-down view; use the Backspace key to switch between top-down view and the first-person view of your character. In top-down view, the [ and ] keys will change the view zoom level; the \ and Shift+\ keys will change the information overlayed on the terrain.</p>
        <p>The <b>Construction (F11)</b> window offers controls for constructing buildings and roads. The column of small buttons on the right selects a category of buildings. Each of the large square buttons builds something. The lower section shows information about the building selected for construction; it also has buttons for selecting the construction material</p>
        <img src="images/icons/FlagTownSqare.png" align="left">
        <p>Click the Town Square button to start building a town square. The Construction Materials section shows the town square requires only a flag. The terrain requirement is Land Not Near Anything which means the town square must be built entirely on land and it cannot be placed next to any existing building.</p>
        <img src="images/icons/HandLeft.png" align="left">
        <p>Use the hand cursor to select a location on the terrain to build the town square. Press the Enter key or hold the Ctrl key to use the hand cursor. A green box will appear at the build location on the terrain. Click on the ground to build the town square.</p>
        <p>After the town square is built, the city can be expanded. The general rule for construction is that everything must be built next to a road or next to the town square. There are a few minor exceptions, such as parks and zoos.</p>
        <img src="images/icons/bp_RoadDirt.bmp" align="left" height="32"  style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0.2em;">
        <p>Roads are used to expand the reach of the city. When starting a city, dirt roads should be used. Dirt roads require the least amount of labor and no building materials are needed. <span style="color: red">Keep in mind roads cannot be upgraded, and roads have different widths. You may want to use stone roads first as they are the next cheapest thing.</span></p>
        <img src="images/LaborDirtRoad.png" align="left" style="margin-right: 0.2em;">
        <p>Use the hand cursor to select a starting location for the road, next to the town square. After clicking to place a starting location move the cursor to where you want the road to end and click again. <b> Note that when you scroll the mouse wheel, a special kind of road section called a <i>slab</i> is created.</b> They generally just look like ultra-wide roads but slabs are used to designate airports and vehicle spawn locations next to factories, this will come later.</p>
        <p>After clicking on the ground, the terrain tile changes to a road construction appearance. Move your character to stand within the road construction area then display the Labor (F10) window. The left box is empty, showing that no materials are consumed. The right box shows things that affect the process but are not consumed. Bottom left is a check box labeled Employ Citizen. This has no effect yet because your town has no citizens. Bottom right shows 1 Labor Needed. Press the Work button to apply labor. Construction of the dirt road section is complete.</p>
        
        <h4>The Stone Age</h4>
        <img src="images/icons/c_Stone.png" align="left" height="48" style="margin-right: 0.2em;">
        <img src="images/LaborMine.png" align="right" class="responsive-img" style="margin-right: 0.2em; max-width: 65%;"/>
        <p>Construction materials are needed to build most buildings. In this example we will build everything out of stone. Use top-down view to locate stone.</p>
        <img src="images/icons/bMine.png" align="left">
        <p>On the Construction window, click the Mine button to start building a mine where the stone is located. You may need to build dirt road sections until the road passes next to the stone. A mine can be up to four levels deep, depending on the number of rocks present in the terrain tile. The cursor shows a green number which is the number of levels to build. Roll the mouse wheel to change the number of levels. Build as many levels as possible at the stone outcropping.</p>
        <p>After clicking on the ground, the terrain tile changes to a building construction appearance. Move your character to stand within the mine construction area. Construction of a mine does not require any materials, just labor. Press begin working until all levels of the mine are completed.</p>
        <p>Mine a large amount of stone. If the mine is making anything other than stone, change it to mine stone. 100 units of stone is a good start. This is the most tedious step of getting your first town going. After the first town, you should rarely ever need to do this again.</p>
        <img src="images/icons/CommManifest.png" align="left" height="32">
        <p>The Comm (F3) window can query your town for its current inventory at any time. Select the Trade channel on the Comm and press the Inventory of City button. The city will respond.</p>

        <h4>Food and Shelter</h4>
        <p>A town with homes attracts people to become its citizens. Citizens fetch materials and apply labor to construction and manufacturing jobs of your town, freeing you from that tedium. Citizens need to have food to eat or they will not be very happy; they might even die.</p>
        <img src="images/icons/bFarm.png" align="left"/>
        <p>Use the Construction window to build a two-level farm. 30 units of stone are needed per level. Push the Fetch button to move stone from the city's inventory to the construction site; you may have to push Fetch more than once. A two-level farm adds four homes and three jobs to the town and it produces food. The extra home will result in one extra citizen to do other jobs outside the farm.</p>
        <img src="images/icons/bHouse.png" align="left"/>
        <p>More homes will be needed. Use the Construction window to build a set of four houses. Each house requires 10 units of stone. A patch of four houses adds a total of eight homes and one job to your town.</p>
        <p>Time is needed for citizens to move into your bourgeoning town. Now is a good time to take a break from building the town. Go eat lunch or dinner, maybe even log-off for the night. </p>
        <p>After some time, the town will have an abundant supply of food and stone in its inventory and there will be more people than jobs. Your little village will be ready for growth. From now on, you should only have to plan the buildings and roads and your citizens will do the work.</p>

        <h4>City Report</h4>
        <p>About every 13 minutes, your city mails a status report to you. Use the Mail (F5) window to view your city reports. City reports provide all the information needed to manage a city. City reports older than about 4 hours are automatically deleted from your mailbox. City reports show factors affecting the morale of the citizens. Morale determines whether the population will grow or shrink. A positive morale causes citizens to immigrate into the city. A negative moral causes citizens to emmigrate out of the city. Certain events that occur in a city are carried out at the time the city report is generated. Most importantly, this is when the population of the city changes due to migration of citizens.</p>
        <p>Review the status report periodically as you continue building the city. Each new building will add jobs to the city. More homes and food will be needed as the number of jobs increases. The demands of the citizens will change.</p>
